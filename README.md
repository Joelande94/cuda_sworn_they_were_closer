# CUDA sworn they were closer! 
## A CUDA program that calculates angles between galaxies, as seen from our perspective. There are two data sets, one real and one randomly generated set. The idea is to compare the results to see if the galaxies in the real dataset are distributed differently than the randomly generated set, which could indicate the existence of dark matter.
